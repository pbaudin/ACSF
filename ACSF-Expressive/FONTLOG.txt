This file provides detailed information on the ACSF-Expressive font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the ACSF-Expressive font files
(acsf-expressive-5pt.ttf and acsf-expressive-5pt-light.ttf) and any derivative
works.

# Basic Font Information #

ACSF-Expressive are two similar cursive cross-stitch fonts designed by P. Baudin.
- acsf-expressive-5pt.ttf (cross-stitches placed in a grid)
- acsf-expressive-5pt-light.ttf (cross-stitches without grid)

ACSF-Expressive is a Unicode typeface that supports languages that use the Latin
script and requires the OpenType feature ccmp in addition to the classic
kerning and ligature features.

Since the fonts contain a lot of ligatures, they support partially the Latin-1
Unicode range. The fonts are incomplete but contains the letters used in most
alphabets of European Latin languages (diacritic characters included), Czech
letters with inverted hat, the German eszett ligature and specific letters of
some Scandinave alphabets.

The supported characters are:
- numerics:  `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ° / + - * %`
- uppercase: `A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z`
- lowercase: `a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z`
- circumflex: `Â Ê Î Ô Û â ê î ô û`
- acute: `Á É Í Ó Ú á é í ó ú`
- grave: `À È Ì Ò Ù à è ì ò ù`
- dieris: `Ä Ë Ï Ö Ü Ÿ ä ï ë ö ü ÿ`
- tilde: `Ã Õ Ñ ã ñ õ`
- caron: `Č Š Ž č š ž`
- misc: `Å ẞ Ç Ø Æ Œ å ß ç æ œ ø`
- other: `¿ ? ¡ ! , ; . : ' #`

The fonts contains some special characters:
- `~`: 1pt space
- `_`: 20pt of cross stiches
- `$`: cuts a ligature (including kerning) and doesn't introduce any space.
