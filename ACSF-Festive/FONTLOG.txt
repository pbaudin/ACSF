# FONTLOG for the Festive Advanced Cross-Stitch Fonts #

This file provides detailed information on the ACSF-Festive font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the ACSF-Festive font files
(acsf-festive-5pt.ttf and acsf-festive-5pt-light.ttf) and any derivative
works.

# Basic Font Information #

ACSF-Festive are two similar rock'n roll cross-stitch fonts designed by P. Baudin.
- acsf-festive-5pt.ttf (cross-stitches placed in a grid)
- acsf-festive-5pt-light.ttf (cross-stitches without grid)

ACSF-Festive is a Unicode typeface that supports languages that use the Latin
script and requires the OpenType feature `calt` in addition to the classic
kerning.

Even the fonts don't contain any ligature, they support partially the Latin-1
Unicode range. The fonts are incomplete but contains the letters used in most
alphabets of European Latin languages (diacritic characters included), Czech
letters with inverted hat, the German eszett ligature and specific letters of
some Scandinave alphabets.

The supported characters are:
- numerics:  `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ° / + - * %`
- uppercase: `A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z`
- lowercase: `a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z`
- circumflex: `Â Ê Î Ô Û â ê î ô û`
- acute: `Á É Í Ó Ú á é í ó ú`
- grave: `À È Ì Ò Ù à è ì ò ù`
- dieris: `Ä Ë Ï Ö Ü Ÿ ä ï ë ö ü ÿ`
- tilde: `Ã Õ Ñ ã ñ õ`
- caron: `Č Š Ž č š ž`
- misc: `Å ẞ Ç Ø Æ Œ å ß ç æ œ ø`
- other: `¿ ? ¡ ! , ; . : ' #`

The fonts contains some special characters:
- `~`: 1pt space
- `_`: 20pt of cross stiches
- `$`: cuts a ligature (including kerning) and doesn't introduce any space.
       That character can be used to get the rock'n roll effect: inserting one
       or more `$` at the begining of words may change their layout.
